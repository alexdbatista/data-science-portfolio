## 📊 What's Inside

### Notebook 1: Experimental Data QA & Anomaly Detection
**File:** `01_experimental_data_quality.ipynb`

**Objective:** Assess data quality from an electrocatalyst screening campaign and identify experimental artifacts.

**Key analyses:**
- Voltage/current stability checks (detecting electrode fouling, reference drift)
- Temperature drift effects on electrochemical measurements
- Replicate consistency (CV reproducibility, charge transfer resistance)
- Missing data patterns (sensor failures, measurement gaps)
- Statistical outlier detection with electrochemical context

**Impact:**  
Demonstrates ability to interrogate experimental data and distinguish real chemical effects from measurement artifacts - essential for reliable materials discovery.

### Notebook 2: Multi-Campaign Comparison & Learning
**File:** `02_campaign_comparison_learning.ipynb`

**Objective:** Compare results across multiple experimental campaigns and track how understanding evolves.

**Key analyses:**
- Campaign-to-campaign performance trends
- Batch effects and systematic biases
- Feature importance evolution (which descriptors predict activity)
- Success rate metrics and failure mode classification
- Recommendation prioritization for next experiments

**Impact:**  
Shows how to build cumulative knowledge across experimental campaigns - making learning compound rather than analyzing each campaign in isolation.

### Notebook 3: Scientific Digest & Reporting
**File:** `03_scientific_communication.ipynb`

**Objective:** Create clear, actionable summaries that align cross-functional teams.

**Deliverables:**
- **Executive digest** - Key findings in 1 page for program managers
- **Lab feedback report** - Specific recommendations on experimental design and quality
- **ML feature recommendations** - Which signals should inform model design
- **Computational validation priorities** - Which discrepancies merit DFT/simulation follow-up

**Impact:**  
Demonstrates stakeholder-specific communication - translating complex analysis into actionable insights for different audiences (leadership, experimentalists, ML engineers).
